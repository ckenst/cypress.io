# Cypress

A demo with [CypressIO](https://www.cypress.io/) for STARWEST2019 and [Testing Today's Web Applications workshop](https://github.com/ckenst/testing-todays-web-apps). The more tools we learn, the better chance we have at recognizing when they are valuable.  

## How to run

1. Start the Cypress Test Runner `npm run cypress:open`
2. Start your web server (if hitting a local dev server)
3. Select one of the tests in the runner and a browser from the list to start
